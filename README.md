Internet-based personal assistants are promising devices combining voice control and search technologies to pull out relevant information to domestic users. They are expected to assist in a smart way to household activities, such as to schedule meetings, find locations, reporting  of  cultural  events,  sending  of  messages  and  a  lot  more.  The  information collected by these devices, including personalized lifelogs about their corresponding users, is likely to be stored by well-established Internet players related to web search engines and social media. This can lead to serious privacy risks. The issue of protecting the identity of domestic  users  and  their  sensitive  data  must  be  tackled  at  design  time, to promptly mitigate privacy threats. This repository contains an ongoing implementation of our proposal, that jointly handles the aforementioned issues by combining log anonymization and sanitizable signatures.
